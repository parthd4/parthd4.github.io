I initially worked to create interactive content for our thousands of readers and collaborate to write data-driven articles, but now I am the Managing Online Editor, which means that I lead the paper's entire software development team, including the data, UI/UX, web development, and mobile subteams. We're leading The Daily's digital tranformation and are working to set up cloud infrastructure and a new more modern website. In this highly collaborative role, I work with editors and managers from every section at The Daily to launch projects and maintain our technical infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>All of our visualizations are created using D3.js, and websites are built using React. APIs and web scrapers are written in Python and usually deployed with AWS. Below are some examples of projects I've worked on.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>BLUElab India Project (BLIP) is a sustainable and socially engaged design team that develops simple technology to solve problems in rural Indian communities. Our largest project was a $5 low-smoke cookstove, which is now in use by over a thousand families in 10 different communities. Local women are employed to build these stoves and to teach about the detrimental impacts of indoor smoke pollution.</p>
                    <p>As president, I led a travel team to rural Gujarat to complete thermal and efficiency validation testing on our stoves in May 2019 and another team in January 2020 to strengthen our relationship with the community. I held monthly calls with the leadership of the SETCO Foundation, our primary Indian business partner, and the Center for Socially Engaged Design at the University of Michigan.</p>
                    <p>During the school year, I managed a team of 30 people to create prototypes and secure funding. We also give talks on development at conferences and meetings, and were <a href="https://michiganross.umich.edu/ross-news-blog/2018/12/13/results-are-these-are-most-innovative-startups-launched-u-m-students-year">quarterfinalists</a> of the Michigan Business Challenge Impact Track.</p>

                    <p>This research team aimed to create an open-source, easy to use application for researchers to analyze remote sensing data. I created a Tkinter GUI that interfaced with the team's C++ library. Users were able to load, view, and efficiently zoom into satellite imagery, using the GUI. In addition, I worked to write OpenGL C++ software to render 3D models of trees.</p>
