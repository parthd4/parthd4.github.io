                    <h2>Software Engineering Intern <span>May '20 - Aug '20</span></h2>
                    <p>I collaborated with a team of 3 other interns in an Agile framework to develop a data-sharing web app, where Humana employees can request and track access for Google BigQuery datasets. This application also stored data for future auditing, because much of the data was sensitive.</p>
                    <p>We developed the fronted for the app in Vue.js, the backend REST API with Flask, and used a NoSQL Google Firestore database. Our project was built and released through Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines and deployed to Google Cloud App Engine.</p>
                    <p>I drove the security of our app and implemented a login system that securely combined Google OAuth with Humana's internal active directory. In addition I set up a live dashboard to track our platform's usage and set up email notifications. Since we worked on a small team, I was able to work on both the frontend and backend of the app, in addition to documentation and unit testing.</p>
                    <p>Overall, I really enjoyed working with my team to develop a successful product, applying things I learned in school to my work, and getting experience in Google Cloud Platform and Azure DevOps.</p>

                        <p>After my administrative tasks are done, I worked to automate the processes of creating receipts/invoices and have created data-driven reports to recommend changes to museum programs, based off of attendance and financial data.</p>

                    <h2>Forest Ecology Student Researcher <span>Sep '16 - May '18</span></h2>
                    <p>I researched the phenology (timing of life cycle events) of native and invasive plant species in a forest environment. This involved weekly data collection in the field and analyzing the data through R. We compared our data to that of the National Phenology Network's database and we were able to document the phenological advantages of garlic mustard and other invasive palnts.</p>
                    <p>We found evidence that invasive forbs leaf out earlier than native forbs in forests, which is advantageous because invasive plants can then get more sunlight before the forest canopy closes in. However, invasive shrubs tended to keep their leaves longer into autumn, past when most trees have lost their leaves. This may help invasive shrubs store more energy right before winter. We presented these findings at a student research symposium and to the Arboretum groundkeepers.</p>
